Running the tool
****************

The operation of the Data Searches tool is explained in this section. While the interface is similar between the ArcGIS and MapInfo implementations of the tool, there are some differences. These are pointed out where relevant throughout this document.

As discussed in the :doc:`Setting up the tool <../setup/setup>` section, the Data Searches tool is operated from a GIS project file within which the data required to run the tool is already loaded. It also relies on an Access database with details about the searches, and a configuration document. Therefore, before running the tool, ensure the following conditions are met:

- A GIS document has been created which contains both the search sites layer(s) and the data layers describing protected sites and species that will be queried, as required. 
- An Access database exists that contains the relevant information about the searches, in the correct tables and formats.
- The search sites layer(s) have a column that contains the unique reference for each search, and this reference has the correct format.
- The XML configuration document has been set up correctly, both for general settings and for each individual layer that will be queried. It is named correctly.
- The Data Searches tool has been installed and set up.

Please refer to the :doc:`setup <../setup/setup>` section for further information about any of these requirements.





- Slight differences for MI / AG
- Worked example(s)
- Creating a project with pre-loaded layers
- Note: overwrite of outputs
- Why is this happening (reporting tool â€“ only likely to be the combined sites table unless using same layer at different buffer distances)
- What to do about it (e.g. split the search into two; save into different subdirectories)
