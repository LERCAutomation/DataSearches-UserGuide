* Experience in the use of a relevant GIS software (currently ArcGIS or MapInfo), including selecting, querying and editing features and attributes.
* An understanding of habitat survey methodologies, especially the Integrated Habitat System (IHS).


Administrators
--------------
It is recommended that a person within each organisation is designated as the tool and database administrator. This person should:

* Have an understanding and experience of IT systems management.
* Understand relational database structures.
* Be an expert user of the chosen database system.
* Have qualifications, certified training or equivalent experience in managing databases using that system.
* Have certified training or equivalent experience in advanced features of the relevant GIS software, including defining, joining and exporting layers and creating spatial and attribute indexes.

A technical guide is also available at `HLUTool-TechnicalGuide <https://readthedocs.org/projects/hlutool-technicalguide/>`_ for those of a more 'techie' nature with details on how to install, configure, maintain and upgrade the HLU Tool and associated relational database.

Acknowledgements
================

Many thanks are due to all the LRCs in the south-east of England and their staff who have, and continue to, fund and contribute to the HLU Tool.  It takes a small army of developers, testers and users to build a truly useful tool (especially users who care enough to test new releases, report bugs and discuss feature requests).
